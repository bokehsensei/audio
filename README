Sound captures audio samples and writes them to a fifo (default path: /tmp/microphone)
Internally, uses a lockfree ring buffer, written in C, and the portaudio library to talk to the sound card.

2 scripts make use of the FIFO (/tmp/microphone):
plot, which captures samples and displays them using GnuPlo
stream_audio.py, which does the same in streaming fashion using matplotlib
