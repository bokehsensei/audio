Sound captures audio samples and writes them to a FIFO file (default path: /tmp/microphone)
Internally, uses a lockfree ring buffer, written in C, and the portaudio library to talk to the sound card.

2 scripts make use of the FIFO file (/tmp/microphone):
plot, which captures samples and displays them using GnuPlo
stream_audio.py, which does the same in streaming fashion using matplotlib

Usage:

1/ launch ./sound
2/ ls /tmp/microphone  [ to make sure it's working ]
3/ ./plot or ./stream_audio.py
